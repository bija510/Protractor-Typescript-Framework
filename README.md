## Is TypeScript worth using?
TypeScript is 100% worth it. It's how JavaScript should have been by default. The combination of static type checking with intelligent code completion provides a significant boost in developer productivity. Not only can you work faster, but you can also catch a ton of errors before they arise.

## How to run?
    a. First open the .ts step def file then 
    b. Run this command in terminal "npm run webdriver-update" &
    c. run "npm run cucumbertest"
    d. This will compile into .js file from .ts file and it will run.
